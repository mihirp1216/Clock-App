It will give option to the user from menu that add hour, add minute, add second, and exit the program. Problem is to change it to hour when 60 minutes over. 

What did you do particularly well?
-	I did well on creating menus and switch between option case.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-	I improve my code via creating function for add second, minute, hour, display time, display menu.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-	The most challenging code to write all functions and I overcome by separating those function in there own name. I use google to figure out some math.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-	The skills I need in other project is problem solving when code is break.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
